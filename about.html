                Esports is a merger of technology and sport, and all sports at their core are games. Competitive gaming is now bigger than ever. Year on year, live viewership has grown by over 90%. Sales of games far outstrip combined sales of music and movies - and the gap is increasing as mobile gaming takes hold. Whatever platform you look at - console, PC, mobile or cloud - games provide a place for humanity to meet and play together, in a world often divided. As interest in games increases, so does interest in competitive gaming.
